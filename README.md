IFC Bridge Model Authoring API

The repository is a preliminary bridge model authoring API for IFC, based on IfcOpenShell.

This project is experimental and will evolve over time as I mess around with authoring bridge models using python scripts.

Ultimately, the goal is to contribute this API to the IfcOpenShell project.
